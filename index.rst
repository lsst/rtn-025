   We describe the architectural choices and tradeoffs for the large scale object storage to be used at the USDF.



Introduction
============

Through the decade's long planned operation of the Rubin telescope, we can expect in the order of 50+PB of raw images and over 600PB of other data. The challenges and decisions of its architecture, deployment, maintainence, and lifecycle are document here.


Data Requirements and Challanges
================================


Data Volume, Variety and Access Patterns
----------------------------------------
- overview of the types of data products and size


Challenges and Remediations
---------------------------

- highlight specific things we need to worry about
- high level posisble solutions



Architectural Motivation
========================

- repeatable: well documented
- scalable: both management and performance
- robust: tiering



Technical Design
================

Hardware
--------

- define standard building blocks of storage
- define performance envelopes
- define resilience of solutions



Software
--------

- overview of software solutions
- pros/cons of ceph/minio
- supportabilty of solutions



Operational Processes
=====================

Deployment
----------

- large amounts of storage added per year
- easy to deploy, consistent and repeatable

Monitoring
----------

- hardware and software steady state and failure reporting requirements
- environmentals and zoning?

Common Tasks
------------

- what does hardware failure look like? disks, servers, racks?
- what are the high level responsibilities and roles required?


Life-cycle
----------

- what procedures required to replace hardware?



Proof of Concept
================

Scope and what are we trying to achieve
---------------------------------------

- why kubernetes?
- describe why minio and direct-csi


Deployment Experience
---------------------

- deployment steps and references


Operational Experience
----------------------

- performance benchmarking
- simulating failures







Initial Hardware and Software Choices
=====================================

- dell xe7100 vs wd data102 vs seagate 4u100
- what and why
